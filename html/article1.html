<h1 id="caption">My thoughts on the importance of design</h1>   
        
<h2 id="chapter">Introduction</h2>
        
“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs
<br /><br />
Great design is achieved when a balance between functionality and aesthetics exists. It is rare.<br />
Usually design around us is just too much of aesthetics, making it hard to use, so it's either like some nice image to look at, or just functional, making it so you don't want to be a part of the experience because it hurts your eyes. In both cases it doesn't have the basic and main functionality - making your life better.
<br /><br />
It is really hard to find a balance, which is to be expected. Everything that is quality means that you started with some picture in your mind and in spite of its flexible nature, the many parameters and wild environment, you made it happen in reality.<br />
That is what art is and I am here to make a noise about the design of the environment that makes our world, as something that I have noticed is lacking and something that can be so much better.
<br /><br />
I am using the word "design" by which I mean "creation" and "innovation" in general, just to be clear about that.
<br /><br />
 
<h2 id="chapter">Main</h2>
        
The world around us is not designed for us that well. You could say it is broken. Too many poor quality creations make our UX uncomfortable. That requires changes, but not just any changes. It needs innovation and freshness.
<br /><br />
One of the most important facts in design is our evolution. We have lived in specific environments that shaped us into what we look like today. Based on that, we - carbon based lifeforms, evolved into something special that has specific senses. That ability, or “instinct”, that is meta developed tells us which things are "good" and which are not. More precisely - there are things in nature that have a negative impact on us.
<br /><br />
Our environment has changed, but we have not. We are fundamentally still in the forest, because evolution is a very slow process, whereas our civilization is growing exponentially. Design has a strong impact on our consciousness - it is about how things look, feel, work - how they affect our mind, and how our mind affects our body.<br />
What we need to do is modify our civilization to better fit our evolutionary needs. Great (and the only right kind of) design is all about that - making your life better.<br />
There are tons of creations contrary to our nature that we face every day, e.g. the snooze button on the alarm clock which gives us the possibility to go into a deeper dream and with that making it harder for us to wake up, websites that have very small text or low contrast making it hard to see content, cup handles that are not well-suited for human hand, making it hard to carry and so forth. We can take this to a much bigger scale, e.g. engineering, medicine, architecture, politics...
<br /><br />
There are some creations that I want to emphasize whose idea was good but it went too far in the wrong way. These are social networks, social media and TV.<br />
In general companies in those fields are making content that will occupy our attention, because it is beneficial to them to make us use it more - to hack us. That is the exact opposite of our own evolution and they are paid to do that, which they do very well. Because of that we are starting to forget what it’s like to go outside and meet people and feel the sunlight, which is much more important than sitting and clicking on the keyboard. It not only wastes our time, but also causes health problems along the way.<br />
Bad design has bad consequences.
<br /><br />
All the things I mentioned just work and that’s enough for people to use it, but no one questions how it works, or more importantly how it affects us. Because "it just works", people are happy, but it is too far from great, balanced design. Companies are quiet about it because they are receiving what they want either way.
<br /><br />
Creations around us need to be friendly and helpful. Good design is on our side, it actually helps us live better and happier lives, not the other way around.<br />
As Elon Musk said: "I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad."<br />
We, together, need to fix this world - to make our future bright and exciting.<br />
Otherwise, why live?
<br /><br />
Also, I want to highlight some good creations that I think are going in right direction. Great design is obvious because it feels like you want to be a part of it. For example, Linux - a free and open-source software operating system, Thinkpad laptops, Tesla cars, OnePlus smartphones, the website GitHub, Future of Humanity Institute, Eagle Hills company and so forth.
<br /><br />
There are not many good creations, and that is why I wrote this article, to tell you that we need more of it.
